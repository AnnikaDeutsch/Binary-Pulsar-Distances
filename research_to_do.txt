1. Refamiliarize myself with the code
2. Do another run on DR3 data to see what comes out of it
    a. Do a run on DR3
    b. Test if pretty print works
    c. Create a doc of results from DR3 and compile info abt literature on each system, demographics, etc. 
3. Finish up test suite
4. Write a tutorial notebook to cover basic functionality
    a. One important thing -- when switching between DR2 and DR3, write a list of all that should be done 
        in this process (should this be automated? It is a package so the source code shouldn't have
        to be altered directly when this switch happens)
5. Do some reading into the actual structure of a package to ensure everything I have is actually structured 
    as a package, and the test suites are also formatted properly


From Cordes/Chatterjee meeting 10/26:
Things to adjust in the matching process:
- don't remove pulsar not known to be in binaries
- probably all of the removal should occur afterward the gaia matching 
- pre gaia matching, propagate error on psr posn and pm, and then add in error on gaia posn post matching
- before this, make the plotting function to visualize error on psr post propagation 

- change binary checking to flag rather than removal 

- ok so I ran the matching pipeline without removing pulsars not known to be in binaries, and with a radius
- of 3 arcsec, and that yielded
